# Expo React Native Application Showcase

Welcome to my Expo React Native application showcase repository! This repository contains a modern and sleek React Native application built using Expo. The project demonstrates my skills and learnings in React Native development, including best coding practices, clean and maintainable code, and an amazing UI/UX design.

## Features

- Dynamic Stylesheet and Responsive Design: The application utilizes a dynamic stylesheet and responsive design principles to ensure a consistent and visually appealing experience across different devices.

- Custom Hooks for Fetching Data: I have implemented custom hooks to fetch data from external APIs, allowing for efficient data retrieval and management within the application.

- Search and Pagination Functionality: The application includes a search feature that allows users to search for specific data within the app. Additionally, pagination functionality enables smooth navigation through large datasets.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/expo-react-native-showcase.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd expo-react-native-showcase`

4. Start the Expo development server: `npm start`
